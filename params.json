It simply requires `Python3` and `PyGObject` to be run.\r\n\r\nSimply run `crucipixel` and enjoy!\r\n\r\n### Install schemes\r\n\r\nIf you want to add some basic scheme examples, just run `setup.sh`\r\n\r\n### Add new schemes\r\n\r\nYou can easily create new schemes with `Crucipixel`'s internal editor; if you prefer to code things by hand, the schemes are encoded in a simple JSON format!\r\n\r\n",
